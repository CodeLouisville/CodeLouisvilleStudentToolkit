- Our audience is first-time learners in Code Louisville FEWD.
- I will immediately consider PRs that correct errors in fact, spelling, grammar and proper usage. 
- I will favorably consider PRs that expand examples and links
- I will judiciously consider PRs that suggest new or amended major sections, in established document structure.
- I will not likely consider PRs that contest tone or established structure.
