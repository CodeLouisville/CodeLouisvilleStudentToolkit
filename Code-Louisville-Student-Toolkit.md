# Toolkit for Code Louisville FEWD Students, December 2020

This document describes tactics for success in Code Louisville's Front-End Web Development (FEWD) courses. Tactics include use of time, engagement in required activities, working with mentors and Code Louisville staff, and using tools and resources.

## Use of time

A typical twelve-week Code Louisville course has about the coverage of material and time commitment as a freshman college class. So for a successful Code Louisville course, and assuming the workload of a three credit-hour college class, you will likely have to budget at least six to nine actual hours per week to cover all the material, attend required events, and work on your coding project. 

The time you spend on Code Louisville will be like adding a new work day to your week. This time will compete with your other weekly activities and responsibilities, such as work, child care, family time, and leisure. You will likely need to negotiate with friends, family members and employers and ask their support in your new endeavor.

You may be tempted to extract time for Code Louisville from your sleep time. Please do not do this, as you may become sick and miserable. Recent studies point to sleep as an important component of learning, as if our brains need time to piece together what we've learned in a day. Be happy, be productive, and get your proper sleep.

You will spend time in four required activities: 
- attending weekly mentor-led sessions
- watching Treehouse videos and working problem sets
- attending meetup events in the tech community
- working on a project as described in the FEWD requirements document
    
You will also spend time in other activities:
- setting up and nursing your workstation
- working with Code Louisville staff
- working with mentors
- working with other students
- researching and self-learning in other ways

## Weekly mentor-led sessions

Every week on assigned nights, students will meet together with mentors and Code Louisville staff to discuss progress and difficulties. Mentors will demonstrate certain topics in greater detail, such as workstation setup, website design tips, JavaScript programming, GitHub repository setup, and career directions. Code Louisville staff will discuss course requirements in greater detail.

Each nightly session will last about two hours, and will be conducted via video conferencing for the foreseeable future. Come prepared to describe what your project is about, share ongoing work on your project, ask questions, and possibly answer questions from other students. 

Here are some tactics that may help with weekly sessions:
- Weekly sessions are a good time to get help for difficulties you may be facing.
- Early in building your project, prepare and share a wireframe diagram of your website layout.
- During a video conference, keep your microphone muted when not talking.
- When you do talk, use headphones to help prevent feedback from your end.
- When you share your code editor window, use large text settings.
- Pay attention when other students present, you may see the answer to a problem you have.
- Pay attention when other students present, you may see a chance to answer a question they have.
- When you want to share your project with someone, provide a link to your GitHub project repository.

## Treehouse videos

Treehouse videos and problem sets deliver most of the instruction on design, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. There are about twelve hours of videos. The problem sets may take a little longer to complete.

After week four of the course, expect to transition away from Treehouse videos and begin work on your project. During the course, the videos will be available for you to review.

Here are some tactics that may help with videos and problem sets:
- In Treehouse, it is possible to speed up video playback.
- Ask for help if you get stuck on a problem.
- It is possible to ask and answer questions via the Treehouse forums.
- Review topics in Treehouse as needed as you build your project.

## Tech community meetups

You will be expected to attend at least two tech community meetups per course. Each meetup may consume one to four hours of time, depending on the event. While the pandemic persists, most if not all meetups will be conducted via video conferencing, but this also gives you the chance to participate in out-of-town events.

Code Louisville staff typically post meetup schedules on Slack. Other meetups can be discovered with a Google search. If you find out about a tech meetup that no one knows about, post a link to it in Slack.

Tech meetups are beneficial because:
- they give you a chance to network, to see and be seen
- you can find out about questions and opportunities circulating in the tech community
- you can make new friends and learn about their concerns
- you can let others know what opportunities you are looking for

Here are some tactics that may help with tech community meetups:
- Introduce yourself to someone.
- Introduce two people who have not met.
- Learn someone's name and company.
- Share some of your your experience with someone.
- Ask someone else about their work and experience.

## Building your project

Building your code project will consume much of your remaining time. After you pass your FEWD course, your FEWD website project belongs to you. You can improve and add to it as you please, and even use it as part of a future Code Louisville course. 

Here are some tactics that may help when building your project:
- Plan initially for a minimum number of features based on requirements.
- Add project features from the requirements document as you have time.
- Use Lorem Ipsum text and image placeholders as content.
- Check your progress frequently with mentors and fellow students.
- Get more than one opinion on the health of your project before you turn it in.
- Write clean code. Run your code through code validators and formatters.
- Write clean documentation. Check spelling and grammar. Use clean document structure. Use a spell checker.

## Working with Code Louisville staff

Code Louisville staff run the Code Louisville program, engage with local employers to determine curriculum, set and track program requirements, provide job placement readiness sessions, and track student success. Staff set the terms for what has to be done. 

Please check with Code Louisville staff:
- if you need to change meeting nights
- if you have questions about program requirements
- if you want help finding a meetup
- if you want job readiness advice
- if you have special needs that should be accommodated
- if anything arises that may jeopardize your ability to successfully complete the course

## Working with mentors

Mentors are people in the software development industry who volunteer their time to help Code Louisville students successfully complete their courses. Mentors do not set the requirements of the Code Louisville program, but they do help you navigate them. Mentors facilitate how to get done what has to be done.

Please ask a mentor:
- if you have a question about what you've seen in a Treehouse video
- how to approach website design
- how to use HTML, CSS, or JavaScript in your project
- if you are having problems with your project or how a tool works
- to help resolve Git repository problems
- to look your project over as you near completion
- if you have questions about working in the tech field

## Working with other students

Although the project you turn in should reflect your own work, you are encouraged to work with other students. 

You can share your projects with each other and give each other advice. If you see a question posted on Slack, and you know the answer, you are invited to answer it. This reflects how software developers actually work as they support each other in accomplishing goals.

Think of yourself as being in a community of learners. Even the mentors are in a process of learning. A carreer in software development requires constant learning. And you may be called upon to teach others sooner than you think.

Some tactics that may help when working with other students:
- Trade GitHub repository links, and get each other's project running successfully.
- Have a scheduled study-hall time together each week.
- Share direct-message Slack channels with each other.
- Work on your writing and communication skills.
- Be mutually supportive.

## Study and research

As mentioned above, working through a Code Louisville course is a lot like working through a college course. That means working through a course is going to involve a lot of self-directed learning. You'll have to set your work times, and stick to them. You'll have to focus on murky areas and work on them until they become clear. If you have a problem, you will likely have to research the question yourself and adapt the answer to your specific need. The mentors and Code Louisville staff will help where possible, but most of the effort will come from you.

Here are some study tips that may be helpful:
- Set a goal when you begin your study time, such as "I want to set up Flexbox."
- Have basic documentation and reference material on hand.
- Work on your writing and communication skills.
- Good study is basically exploratative. Set a direction, then hack away at obstacles toward your goal.
- Find out how you learn best. Find a quiet spot, and hold down distractions. 
- Get into a flow as you build that house of cards in your head. 
- When researching on Google, make sure your search terms are accurate enough to locate what you want to find.

## Workflow

Think about workflow. As you build your project, you will 
- write code changes
- save your changes
- see what happens when your changes take effect
- rewrite code until your changes appear to work properly
- commit those changes to your repository
- repeat the steps above

Therefore, your attention will be focused
- in the code editor
- in the browser's main display
- in the browser's debugging tool
- in the Git client
- in GitHub
- repeat the steps above

Think of every loop around this circle as a development "unit of work" that ends with a repository commit and push. 

Here are some workflow tips:
- Have basic documentation and reference material on hand.
- Open all your tools and be aware of how they work together.
- You may eventually want more display monitor "real estate," such as a second larger monitor.
- Keep your unit of work small enough so that your commits are frequent, not much longer than thirty minutes apart.
- Keep your unit of work small enough so that it expresses one idea in the project, such as a new feature or a bug fix.
- Small units of work are easier to reason about if you have to review your past work.
- Small units of work mean your work is being backed up on GitHub more frequently.
- Make a habit of pushing after every commit, since this will ensure that your changes are sent to GitHub.
- When your coding time ends, or you are called away, make a final commit and push. That's a unit of work also.
- Remember that your browser and Git client cannot "see" changes until they are saved in your code editor.

## Debugging

It is inevitable that your website will not work as you expected. You will have to find out what's wrong and fix it. This process of debugging can be very frustrating, and can be very creative and rewarding. The more debugging you do, the better you'll get. 

Before any detailed debugging, run your code through a validator. It's amazing how many little faults, like failing to close a div element, can be discovered by a validator. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript can be validated in this way. Fix all the faults the validator finds, until your code checks clean.

Also before any detailed debugging, run your code through a formatter. Your code editor may assist in code formatting; learn how this feature works and use it. It is amazing how well-formatted and indented code can "snag" your eye to a trouble spot.

Here are some debugging tips:
- Have basic documentation and reference material on hand.
- Pose a concise statement of your problem. This statement may be a basis for a Google search, or for asking for help.
- Chop larger problems into smaller problems, until you have problems too small to fight back.
- When debugging a feature, try it in isolation in a code pen.
- When you add a new feature to your project, start small and simple until you learn all its corners.
- If you've solved a problem that you think may interest others, post a summary of your work on Slack.
- Use the [Rubber Duck method.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging)

## Tools

### Code editors
  
  I've seen students agonize about choosing "the best code editor." You do not have to agonize; just pick a code editor and go with it. If you don't like how it operates, pick another and keep going. The only real requirement for a good code editor for FEWD is that it produce "flat text." Flat text is plainly readable text unadorned with formatting metadata as is produced from a word processor such as Microsoft Word or Libre Office Writer. 
  
  There are a number of good choices for code editors; some are listed below. You may find others with a Google search. Features to look for are keyword highlighting, automatic code formatting, and element generation/closure. 
  
  - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
  - [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/)
  - [Atom](https://atom.io/)
  - [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/)

### Browser

  At end of course, Code Louisville FEWD projects are checked on a Chrome browser. There is no requirement that your project has to work on any other browser. Chrome and Firefox are good choices to develop against; Edge, Safari and Opera less so. Since Internet Explorer has been abandonded by Microsoft, there is little reason to develop for it except as an exercise in pain.

  Whatever browser you choose, learn to use its built-in developer inspection tools. These tools can give you a large amount of information about the behavior of your website, such as: Where does a certain element get its styling? Why is my JavaScript returning the wrong results? And, why is an image not being found? Developer tools allow you single-step through a JavaScript program, and alter CSS statements within the browser to immediately debug styling problems.

    - [Chrome DevTools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools)
    - [Mozilla (Firefox)](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/)
    - [Firefox Developer Tools](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools)

### Git and GitHub

  Git and GitHub can be difficult to master, if you're not worked with repository technology before. But as you do master it, I think you'll see that they provide a lot of useful services to you and your projects. It is best to start early in learning Git and GitHub. Practice and review getting a local repository set up and pushed, and do this several times until you are reasonably comfortable with the process. Try to get big questions about their use settled before you begin your project. Do not by any means wait until the end of the course to deal with Git and GitHub, as this will likely not work well for you.
  
  There are a large number of Git clients available, such as the one built into Visual Studeo Code, or the standalone Git GUI client. Because mentors have various experiences with Git clients, and because students have different tools and operating systems installed on their workstations, and because Treehouse offers instruction is just the command-line version of Git, it is important that FEWD students use the command-line version of Git. For Windows, this means the Git Bash client; for Mac, this is the Terminal client. In later courses, you may use other Git clients you prefer. But for FEWD, please master the command-line Git client.
  
  Here are some of the services that Git and GitHub provide:
  - Git tracks and keeps a record of all the work you've done on your project.
  - Git uses a chaining scheme to assure that your repository cannot be falsified by bad actors.
  - Git allows you to work in speculative "branches," then merge those branches into main development later.
  - Git and GitHub can coordinate the work of multiple people on a single project.
  - Git and Github allow for each developer to be disconnected from each other, and join work together later.
  - GitHub allows you to share your work and ideas around the world for free.
  - GitHub allows you to find and examine the work of many talented people around the world.
  - GitHub allows you to collaborate with other software projects.
  - Github can be used for other digital work, such as books and musical scores.
  - GitHub can help build, deploy and host your projects.

### Hosting

  There are several ways to convey your project to someone who is interested in a running and examining it. However you chose, make sure you describe in your project README how a guest can put your project into action.
  
  - Have your guest clone or download your project to their workstation, then point their browser to the index.html file.
  - Have GitHub host your project, and give your guest a link to that site. [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
  - Subscribe to a hosting site, such as Azure or AWS, and point your guest to that site.

## Final Thoughts

What you are about to do in Code Louisville will not be easy. It will be time-consuming, frustrating at times, confusing at times. A lot of what you get out of Code Louisville will be what you drag out by its ears. 

But you likely have been motivated by some thought about making a change, of a better-paying or more interesting job, of at least trying the waters to see what's out there. If you don't find what you're looking for at Code Louisville, keep looking, and thanks for hanging out with us for a while. 

Code Louisville mentors and staff want you to succeed. We believe there's a spot for you somewhere as a software developer. Keep coding.
