# Toolkit for Code Louisville FEWD Students, December 2020

This document describes tactics for success in Code Louisville's Front-End Web Development (FEWD) sessions. 

Tactics include use of time, engagement in required activities, working with mentors and Code Louisville staff, and using other tools and resources.

## Use of time

A typical twelve-week Code Louisville session has about the coverage of material and time commitment as a freshman college class. So for a successful Code Louisville session, and assuming the workload of a three credit-hour college class, you will likely have to budget at least six to nine actual hours per week to cover all the material and work on your coding project. 

Your time spent on Code Louisville will be like adding a new work day to your week. This time will be extracted from your other weekly activities and responsibilities, such as work, child care and family time, and leisure. You will likely need to negotiate with friends, family members and employers and ask their support in your new endeavor.

You may be tempted to extract time for Code Louisville from your sleep time. Please do not do this, as you may become sick and miserable. Recent studies point to sleep as an important component of learning, as if our brains need time to piece together what we've learned in a day. Be happy, be productive, and get your proper sleep.

Your time will be spent in four required activities: 
- attending weekly mentor-led sessions
- videos and problem sets from Treehouse
- meetups with the tech community
- delivery of a project as described in the FEWD requirements document
    
You will also spend time in other activities:
- working with Code Louisville staff
- working with mentors
- working with other students
- setting up your workstation
- researching and self-learning in other ways

## Weekly mentor-led sessions

Every week on assigned nights, students will meet together with mentors and Code Louisville staff to discuss progress and difficulties. Mentors will demonstrate certain topics in greater detail, such as workstation setup, website design tips, JavaScript programming, Github repository setup, and career directions. Code Louisville staff will discuss course requirements in greater detail.

Each nightly session will last about two hours, and will be conducted via video conferencing for the foreseeable future. Come prepared to describe what your project is about, share ongoing work on your project, ask questions, and possibly answer questions from other students. 

Here are some tactics that may help with weekly sessions:
- early in building your project, prepare and share a wire diagram of your website layout
- weekly sessions are a good time to get help for difficulties you may be facing
- during a video conference, keep your microphone muted when not talking
- when you do talk, use headphones to help prevent feedback from your end
- when you share your text editor window, use large text settings
- pay attention when other students present, you may see the answer to a problem you are having
- pay attention when other students present, you may see a chance to help answer a question they have
- when you want to share your project with someone, provide a link to your Github project repository

## Treehouse videos

Treehouse videos and problem sets deliver most of the instruction on design, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. There are about twelve hours of videos. The problem sets may take a little longer to complete.

After week four of the session, expect to transition away from Treehouse videos and begin work on your project. During the session, the videos will be available for you to review.

Here are some tactics that may help with videos and problem sets:
- in Treehouse, it is possible to speed up video playback
- try the problem sets, but do not get stuck on them; ask for help if needed
- it is possible to ask and answer questions via the Treehouse forums
- use Treehouse for closer review of topics as you build your project

## Tech community meetups

You will be expected to attend at least two tech community meetups per session. Each meetup may consume one to four hours of time, depending on the event. While the pandemic persists, most if not all meetups will be conducted via video conferencing, but this also gives you the chance to participate in out-of-town events.

Code Louisville staff typically post meetup schedules on Slack. Other meetups can be discovered with a Google search.

Tech meetups are beneficial because:
- they give you a chance to network, to see and be seen
- you can find out about questions and opportunities circulating in the tech community
- you can make new friends and learn about their concerns
- you can let others know what opportunities you are looking for

Here are some tactics that may help with tech community meetups:
- introduce yourself to someone
- introduce two people who have not met
- learn someone's name and company
- share some of your your experience with someone
- ask someone else about their work and experience

## Building your project

Building your project will consume much of your remaining time. After you pass your FEWD session, your FEWD website project belongs to you. You can improve and add to it as you please, and even use it as part of a future Code Louisville session. 

Here are some tactics that may help when building your project:
- plan initially for a minimum number of features based on requirements
- add project features from the requirements document as you have time
- use Lorem Ipsum text and image placeholders as content
- check your progress frequently with mentors and fellow students
- get several mentors and fellow students to check your project
- write clean code and clean documentation

## Working with Code Louisville staff

Code Louisville staff run the Code Louisville program, engage with local employers to determine curriculum, set and track program requirements, provide job placement readiness sessions, and track student success. Staff set the terms for what has to be done. 

Please check with Code Louisville staff:
- if you need to change meeting nights
- if you have questions about program requirements
- if you want help finding a meetup
- if you want job readiness advice
- if you have special needs that should be accommodated
- if anything arises that may jeopardize your ability to successfully complete the session

## Working with mentors

Mentors are people in the software development industry who volunteer their time to help Code Louisville students successfully complete their sessions. Mentors do not set the requirements of the Code Louisville program, but they do help you navigate them. Mentors facilitate how to get done what has to be done.

Please ask a mentor:
- if you have a question about what you've seen in a Treehouse video
- how to approach website design
- if you have questions about working in the tech field
- how to use HTML, CSS, or JavaScript in your project
- to help resolve git repository problems
- to look your project over as you near completion

## Working with other students

Although the project you turn in should reflect your own work, you are encouraged to work with other students. 

You can share your projects with each other and give each other advice. If you see a question posted on Slack, and you know the answer, you are invited to answer it. This reflects how software developers actually work as they support each other in accomplishing goals.

Some tactics that may help when working with other students:
- trade Github repository links, and get each other's project running successfully
- have a scheduled study-hall time together each week
- share direct-message Slack channels with each other
- be mutually supportive

## Study, ask questions, solve problems

As mentioned above, working through a Code Louisville session is a lot like working through a college course. That means working through a session is going to involve a lot of self-directed learning. You'll have to set your work times, and stick to them. You'll have to focus on murky areas and work on them until they become clear. If you have a problem, you will likely have to research the question yourself and adapt the answer to your specific need. The mentors and Code Louisville staff will help where possible, but most of the effort will come from you.

Good study is basically exploratative. You try to find out what's out there, set a direction, and hack away at obstacles you encounter. Learn the names of the things you want to know about, as they will become search terms for Google. Learn the relationships between things, and a little something about why they exist.
