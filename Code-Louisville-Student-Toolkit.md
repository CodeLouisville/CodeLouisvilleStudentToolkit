# Toolkit for Code Louisville FEWD Students

This document will describe tactics for success in Code Louisville's Front-End Web Development (FEWD) session. 

Tactics include use of time, engagement in required activities, engagement with mentors and Code Louisville staff, and using other tools and resources.

## Use of time

A typical twelve-week Code Louisville session has about the coverage of material and commitment to time as a freshman or sophomore college class. So for a successful Code Louisville session, and assuming the workload of a three credit-hour college class, you will likely have to budget at least six to nine actual hours per week to cover all the material and work on your coding project. 

So your time spent on Code Louisville will be like adding a new work day to your week. This time will be extracted from your other weekly activities and responsibilities, such as work, child care and family time, and leisure. You will likely need to negotiate with friends, family members and employers and ask for their allowances to support your new endeavor.

You may be tempted to extract time for Code Louisville from your sleep time. Please do not do this, as you may become sick and miserable. Recent studies point to sleep as an important component of learning, as if our brains need time to piece together what we've learned in a day. Be happy, be productive, and get your proper sleep.

Your time will be spent in four required activities: 
    - attending weekly mentor-led sessions
    - videos and problem sets from Treehouse
    - meetups with the tech community
    - delivery of a project as described in the FEWD requirements document

## Weekly mentor-led sessions

Every week on assigned nights, students will meet together with mentors and Code Louisville staff to discuss progress and difficulties. Mentors will demonstrate certain topics in greater detail, such as workstation setup, website design tips, JavaScript programming, git and Github, and career directions. Code Louisville staff will discuss course requirements in greater detail.

Each nightly session will last about two hours, and will be conducted via video conferencing for the foreseeable future. Come prepared to describe what your project is about, share ongoing work on your project, ask questions, and possibly answer questions from other students. 

## Treehouse videos

Treehouse videos and problem sets deliver most of the instruction on design, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. There are about twelve hours of videos. The problem sets may take a little longer to complete.

After week four of the session, expect to transition away from Treehouse videos and begin work on your project. During the session, the videos will be available for you to review.

--- speed up time
--- ask for help with problem sets
--- ask and answer questions via Treehouse forums

## Tech community meetups

You will be expected to attend at least two tech commnity meetups per session. Each meetup may consume one to four hours of time, depending on the event. While the pandemic persists, most if not all meetups will be conducted via video conferencing, but this also gives you the chance to participate in out-of-town events.

Tech meetups give you a  chance to network
Find out about questions and opportunities circulating in the tech community
Make new friends and learn about their concerns
Let others know what opportunities you are looking for

Code Louisville staff typically post meetup schedules on Slack. Other meetups can be discovered with a Google search.

## Building your project

Building your project will consume much of your remaining time. Consider the following tactics when building your project:
    ### plan initially for a minimum viable project based on requirements
    ### add project features from the requirements document as you have time
    ### use Lorem Ipsum text and image placeholders as content
    ### check your progress frequently with mentors and fellow students
    ### get several mentors and fellow students to check your project
    ### write clean code and clean documentation
    
After you pass your FEWD session, your FEWD website project belongs to you. You can improve and add to it as you please, and even use it as part of a future Code Louisville session. 

## Engagement with Code Louisville staff

Code Louisville staff run the Code Louisville program, engage with local employers to determine curriculum, set and track program requirements, provide job placement readiness sessions, and track student success. Staff set the terms for what has to be done. 

For any question you have regarding requirements and attendance, please check with Code Louisville staff. If anything arises that may jeopardize your ability to successfully complete a Code Louisville session, please talk to Code Louisville staff.

## Engagement with mentors

Mentors are people in the software developers who volunteer their time to help students successfully complete their sessions. Mentors do not set the requirements of the Code Louisville program, but they do help you navigate them. Mentors facilitate how to get done what has to be done.

If you have a question about what you've seen in a Treehouse video, or about how to approach website design, or about JavaScript programming, ask a mentor. When you are about to finish your project, ask a mentor (or two!) to look it over. 

## Engagement with other students

Although the project you turn in should reflect your own work, you are encouraged to work with other students. 

You can share your projects with each other, to make sure these projects will work on other workstations. If you see a question posted on Slack, and you know the answer, you are invited to answer it. This reflects how software developers actually work as they support each other in accomplishing goals.
